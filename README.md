# FEARS Data

This repository is (ATM) a very basic breakdown of the [FDA's FEARS](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/default.htm) database.  While doing research on this topic, I realized that I could not find a source for a simple relational DB and that even just parsing these files was a pain to do.

This repository is created so that others could get bypass the painful parsing and get to the data analysis quickly.  To use, simply download all the FDA AERS/FAERS ASCII zip files and place them in the data folder and then run ```python parse.py```, or you could download the file from my DropBox if you'd like as well [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2187254/faers-data-sqlite.zip).

As you can imagine, I am not responsible for any conclusions or problems you find with the data.  Feedback and requests are totally welcome.
